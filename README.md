## üìñ Introduction

**BlackBox Staking** is a groundbreaking decentralized staking protocol that leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to provide complete privacy for staking operations. Unlike traditional staking protocols where all balances and transactions are publicly visible on-chain, BlackBox Staking ensures that your staking amounts, balances, and activities remain confidential while maintaining the security and verifiability of blockchain technology.

Built on [Zama's FHEVM](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm) (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) and implementing the [ERC7984 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7984) for confidential tokens, BlackBox Staking represents the next evolution of privacy-preserving DeFi infrastructure.

### Why "BlackBox"?

The name "BlackBox" reflects the core principle of the protocol: **your staking activity is your business alone**. Just like a black box in aviation that securely records data, our protocol securely encrypts your staking data, making it invisible to outside observers while remaining cryptographically verifiable.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîê Complete Privacy
- **Encrypted Balances**: All staking balances are stored as encrypted values (euint64) on-chain
- **Private Transactions**: Staking and unstaking amounts are never revealed publicly
- **Confidential Totals**: Even the total amount staked across all users is encrypted
- **User-Only Decryption**: Only you can decrypt and view your own staking balance

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety
- **Safe Math Operations**: Uses `FHESafeMath` for secure arithmetic on encrypted values
- **Underflow Protection**: Prevents unstaking more than staked balance without revealing amounts
- **Input Validation**: Robust authorization checks for encrypted inputs
- **Auditable Logic**: Clear separation of concerns with internal helper functions

### üöÄ Advanced Technology
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Perform calculations on encrypted data without decryption
- **ERC7984 Compliance**: Implements the latest standard for confidential tokens
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient operations designed for minimal gas consumption
- **Event Emission**: Proper event logging for off-chain tracking (with encrypted values)

### üéØ MEV Protection
- **Front-Running Resistant**: Encrypted amounts prevent front-running attacks
- **MEV Proof**: Bots cannot analyze or exploit staking patterns
- **Fair Operations**: Level playing field for all participants

---

## üéØ Problems Solved

### 1. **Privacy in DeFi**
**Problem**: Traditional staking protocols expose all user balances and transaction amounts, revealing financial strategies and holdings to competitors, attackers, and the public.

**Solution**: BlackBox Staking encrypts all sensitive data using FHE, ensuring that only the user can decrypt their own information while still allowing the protocol to perform calculations and maintain security.

### 2. **Front-Running & MEV Exploitation**
**Problem**: In transparent blockchain systems, malicious actors can observe pending transactions and front-run large staking operations, extracting value through MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks.

**Solution**: Since all staking amounts are encrypted, attackers cannot determine the value of pending transactions, effectively eliminating front-running opportunities and MEV exploitation.

### 3. **Competitive Disadvantage for Institutions**
**Problem**: Large institutional investors and protocols need to protect their staking strategies from competitors who can analyze their on-chain behavior.

**Solution**: Encrypted operations allow institutions to stake and manage positions without revealing their strategy, timing, or capital allocation to competitors.

### 4. **User Profiling & Tracking**
**Problem**: Public blockchain data enables detailed profiling of users' financial activities, creating privacy concerns and potential security risks.

**Solution**: BlackBox Staking prevents profiling by encrypting all financial data, making it impossible to track individual user behavior or build financial profiles.

### 5. **Whale Watching & Market Manipulation**
**Problem**: Large holders ("whales") are often tracked and their movements can cause market panic or manipulation.

**Solution**: Encrypted balances and operations prevent whale watching, reducing market manipulation and creating a more stable ecosystem.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. **ERC7984ETH.sol** - Confidential Token
```solidity
contract ERC7984ETH is ERC7984
```

A privacy-preserving token implementation following the ERC7984 standard:
- **Token Name**: mETH (Mock ETH for testing)
- **Token Symbol**: mETH
- **Encryption**: All balances stored as encrypted uint64 values
- **Free Minting**: `mintFree()` function for testing (1 mETH per call)
- **Confidential Transfers**: Fully encrypted transfer operations

#### 2. **METHStaking.sol** - Staking Protocol
```solidity
contract METHStaking is SepoliaConfig
```

The core staking contract with the following capabilities:

**State Variables:**
- `_stakedBalances`: Mapping of encrypted staking balances per user
- `_totalStaked`: Encrypted total of all staked tokens
- `methToken`: Immutable reference to the ERC7984 token

**Core Functions:**
- `stake(externalEuint64, bytes)`: Stake tokens with encrypted amount and proof
- `stake(euint64)`: Stake tokens with pre-encrypted amount
- `unstake(externalEuint64, bytes)`: Unstake tokens with encrypted amount and proof
- `unstake(euint64)`: Unstake tokens with pre-encrypted amount
- `stakedBalanceOf(address)`: View encrypted staked balance
- `confidentialTotalStaked()`: View encrypted total staked

**Security Features:**
- Authorization validation for encrypted inputs
- Safe increase/decrease operations with overflow protection
- Automatic permission management for FHE operations
- Event emission for transparency (with encrypted values)

## ‚ùì FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)?**
A: FHE is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This enables privacy-preserving smart contracts where sensitive data remains encrypted on-chain.

**Q: Is BlackBox Staking secure?**
A: The protocol uses battle-tested cryptographic primitives from Zama's FHEVM. However, it has not yet undergone a formal security audit. Use on testnets only until mainnet launch.

**Q: How much does it cost to use?**
A: Gas costs for FHE operations are higher than traditional operations due to the computational overhead of homomorphic encryption. We're actively optimizing to reduce costs.

**Q: Can anyone see my staking balance?**
A: No. Your staking balance is encrypted on-chain and can only be decrypted by you using your private key.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What is ERC7984?**
A: ERC7984 is a proposed standard for confidential tokens that use homomorphic encryption to keep balances and transfer amounts private while maintaining blockchain security.

**Q: Why use euint64 instead of regular uint?**
A: euint64 is an encrypted 64-bit unsigned integer that enables homomorphic operations. All arithmetic happens on encrypted values, maintaining privacy.

**Q: Can I integrate this with my DeFi protocol?**
A: Yes! The protocol is designed to be composable. Check our documentation for integration guides.

**Q: What networks are supported?**
A: Currently: Sepolia testnet and local development. Mainnet launch planned for Q1 2026.

### Privacy Questions

**Q: What information is encrypted?**
A: Staking amounts, balances, and total staked amounts are all encrypted. Only you can decrypt your own data.

**Q: Can the contract owner see my balance?**
A: No. Even the contract owner cannot decrypt user balances. Only the user with the private key can decrypt their data.

**Q: How does MEV protection work?**
A: Since transaction amounts are encrypted, MEV bots cannot determine transaction values and therefore cannot front-run or extract value.
